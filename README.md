# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

## Overview
Breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer and the second largest contributor to women's cancer-related fatalities. breast cancer has a high mortality rate and a low survival rate, early detection is essential. Predicting and diagnosing breast cancer early has been the main use of deep learning algorithms. This work suggests a better method for classifying breast cancer using a Breast Cancer Convolutional Neural Network (BC-CNN). 

When working with the Breast Cancer Dataset, preprocessing techniques such picture scaling are applied. Using the pre-processed dataset, the BC-CNN, a technique for categorizing breast cancer patients into four groups invasive, in situ, and normal will be trained.

The objective of this suggested methodology is to increase the precision and dependability of breast cancer diagnosis, enabling prompt intervention and individualized treatment plans according to the individualstage of the illness. The accuracy of the suggested method is assessed by comparing it to the capsule network.

## Introduction
When cancer starts in the breast tissue, it becomes breast cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with 7.8 million people surviving as of the end of 2020 who received a diagnosis during the previous five years. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are artificial neural networks designed primarily to understand pixel input. For image classification, deep learning (DL) with convolutional neural networks (DCNN) has shown to be one of the most successful machine learning (ML) techniques. The Convolutional mapping preserves the most important differential properties of the input data while reducing its dimension. It is well known that convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a type of regular neural networks. This technique provides a unique network that prioritizes ultimately linked hidden layers above convolution and pooling layers . CNN can be used for two purposes: classifier and feature extraction. The findings of  patches are pooled for the whole picture to get the  final  result .

## Objective
The objectives include improving diagnostic accuracy and enhancing our overall comprehension of the diverse nature. It involve refining  architecture for better performance, and diverse datasets optimizing computational efficiency.

## Proposed Methodlogy

Our goal is to use a Breast Cancer Convolutional Neural Network (BC-CNN) to improve the classification of breast cancer. The Breast Cancer Dataset, which includespictures of breast tissue samples with the labels in situ, invasive, normal, and benign, was used in this study. We used methods like image resizing to preprocess the photos. The pre-processed dataset was then used to train the BC-CNN, which divided the breast tissue samples into four groups: benign, in situ, invasive, and normal. Moreover, if categories for benign, in situ, and invasive conditions are included in the classification output. Lastly, we assessed our modelâ€™s effectiveness by determining how accurately it classified the samples of breast tissue. This methodology improves breast cancer classification by combining the strength of deep learning with cutting-edge signal processing techniques, offering important insights for early detection and treatment planning.

BB-CNN: For processing and recognizing images, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a particular type of artificial neural network that are designed to handle pixel input.The "neurons" in CNN are organised more like those in the frontal lobe, which is where humansand other animals' processing of visual inputs occurs. To circumvent the issue of piecemeal picture processing that plagues typical neural networks, the layers of neurons are designed to encompass the whole visual field. With its reduced processing requirements in mind, a CNN uses a system that is like a multilayer perceptron. The input layer, output layer, and hidden layerwhich consists of several convolutional layers, Maxpooling layers, and fully connected layersare the layers that make up a CNN.
